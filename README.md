# ROFuture

## IMPORTANT: in this early stage of the mod, please avoid adding advanced far-future engines. Let's start with the near future stuff.

### What is this?
A **very** WIP mod that aims to add near (and eventually far) future parts and gameplay to RealismOverhaul and RP-1.
Like RO, this is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to contribute; but again, like RO, contribution requires some research to be approved, albeit in a more loose way.
**Every config here should at least be theoretically possible, even if impractical or far from possible with current engineering techniques.**

This means that this mod can house anything from a speculative nuclear reactor (even fusion ones, but with real physics) to a 100m habitation ring, including speculative chemical and nuclear engines and even more exotic kinds of propulsion. 
It also means that your warp drive doesn't belong here, and neither does an EM drive or anything with shady physics behind it. 
That said, if you can provide correct calculations for your contribution, then it can be accepted! Congratulations!

*Kerbalism support should also be a priority*. It might become a RP-1 dependency in the future, and it already is a very popular LS choice for RO players; its seamless background processing is basically unmatched.


### What this mod *isn't*

KSPIE or MKS but for RO. While it may eventually reach KSPIE levels of complexity, it should never aim for the same versability or gameyfication. As with any Realism mod, it should always be well-sourced (with the subtleties highlited in the previous section).


## What you can realistically expect from this mod
- speculative engine configs
- speculative solar panels, crew habitats, radiators
- eventually, procedural reactors
